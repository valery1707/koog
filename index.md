# Overview

Koog is an open-source JetBrains framework designed to build and run AI agents entirely in idiomatic Kotlin. It lets you create agents that can interact with tools, handle complex workflows, and communicate with users.

The framework supports the following types of agents:

- Single-run agents with minimal configuration that process a single input and provide a response. An agent of this type operates within a single cycle of tool-calling to complete its task and provide a response.
- Functional agents with lightweight, customizable logic defined by a lambda function to handle user input, interact with an LLM, call tools, and produce a final output.
- Complex workflow agents with advanced capabilities that support custom strategies and configurations.

## Key features

Key features of Koog include:

- **Multiplatform development**: Deploy agents across JVM, JS, WasmJS, Android, and iOS targets using Kotlin Multiplatform.
- **Reliability and fault-tolerance**: Handle failures with built-in retries and restore the agent state at specific points during execution with the agent persistence feature.
- **Intelligent history compression**: Optimize token usage while maintaining context in long-running conversations using advanced built-in history compression techniques.
- **Enterprise-ready integrations**: Utilize integration with popular JVM frameworks such as Spring Boot and Ktor to embed Koog into your applications.
- **Observability with OpenTelemetry exporters**: Monitor and debug applications with built-in support for popular observability providers (W&B Weave, Langfuse).
- **LLM switching and seamless history adaptation**: Switch to a different LLM at any point without losing the existing conversation history, or reroute between multiple LLM providers.
- **Integration with JVM and Kotlin applications**: Build AI agents with an idiomatic, type-safe Kotlin DSL designed specifically for JVM and Kotlin developers.
- **Model Context Protocol integration**: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools in AI agents.
- **Knowledge retrieval and memory**: Retain and retrieve knowledge across conversations using vector embeddings, ranked document storage, and shared agent memory.
- **Powerful Streaming API**: Process responses in real-time with streaming support and parallel tool calls.
- **Modular feature system**: Customize agent capabilities through a composable architecture.
- **Flexible graph workflows**: Design complex agent behaviors using intuitive graph-based workflows.
- **Custom tool creation**: Enhance your agents with tools that access external systems and APIs.
- **Comprehensive tracing**: Debug and monitor agent execution with detailed, configurable tracing.

## Available LLM providers and platforms

The LLM providers and platforms whose LLMs you can use to power your agent capabilities:

- Google
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter
- Ollama
- Bedrock

For detailed guidance on using these providers with dedicated LLM clients, refer to [Runnning prompts with LLM clients](prompt-api/#running-prompts-with-llm-clients).

## Installation

To use Koog, you need to include all necessary dependencies in your build configuration.

**NB!** Ktor [client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-engines.html) and [server](https://ktor.io/docs/server-engines.html) engine dependencies are not included in the library by default, so you should add engines of your choice yourself.

### Gradle

#### Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle.kts` file:

   ```text
   dependencies {
       implementation("ai.koog:koog-agents:LATEST_VERSION")
      // include Ktor client dependency explicitly
       implementation("io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:$ktor_version")
   }
   ```

   Ktor [client](https://ktor.io/docs/client-engines.html) and [server](https://ktor.io/docs/server-engines.html) engine dependencies are not included in the library by default, so you should add engines of your choice yourself.

1. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.

#### Gradle (Groovy)

1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle` file:

   ```text
   dependencies {
       implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents:LATEST_VERSION'
       implementation 'io.ktor:ktor-client-cio:KTOR_VERSION'
   }
   ```

1. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.

### Maven

1. Add dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>
       <artifactId>koog-agents-jvm</artifactId>
       <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

1. Add Ktor dependencies. Check for Ktor versions [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ktor/ktor-bom).

   ```xml
   <dependencyManagement>
       <dependencies>
           <dependency>
               <groupId>io.ktor</groupId>
               <artifactId>ktor-bom</artifactId>
               <version>KTOR_VERSION</version>
               <type>pom</type>
               <scope>import</scope>
           </dependency>
       </dependencies>
   </dependencyManagement>

   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.ktor</groupId>
           <artifactId>ktor-client-cio-jvm</artifactId>
           <scope>runtime</scope>
       </dependency>
       <!-- Add a Ktor server dependency if you are using features like MCP -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.ktor</groupId>
           <artifactId>ktor-server-netty-jvm</artifactId>
           <scope>runtime</scope>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

1. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral` in the list of repositories.

## Quickstart example

To help you get started with AI agents, here is a quick example of a single-run agent:

Note

Before you run the example, assign a corresponding API key as an environment variable. For details, see [Getting started](single-run-agents/).

```kotlin
fun main() {
    runBlocking {
        val apiKey = System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.

        val agent = AIAgent(
            promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(apiKey), // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.
            systemPrompt = "You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions concisely.",
            llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o
        )

        val result = agent.run("Hello! How can you help me?")
        println(result)
    }
}
```

For more details, see [Getting started](single-run-agents/).
