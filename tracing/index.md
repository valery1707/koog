# Tracing

This page includes details about the Tracing feature, which provides comprehensive tracing capabilities for AI agents.

## Feature overview

The Tracing feature is a powerful monitoring and debugging tool that captures detailed information about agent runs, including:

- Strategy execution
- LLM calls
- LLM streaming (start, frames, completion, errors)
- Tool calls
- Node execution within the agent graph

This feature operates by intercepting key events in the agent pipeline and forwarding them to configurable message processors. These processors can output the trace information to various destinations such as log files or other types of files in the filesystem, enabling developers to gain insights into agent behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.

### Event flow

1. The Tracing feature intercepts events in the agent pipeline.
1. Events are filtered based on the configured message filter.
1. Filtered events are passed to registered message processors.
1. Message processors format and output the events to their respective destinations.

## Configuration and initialization

### Basic setup

To use the Tracing feature, you need to:

1. Have one or more message processors (you can use the existing ones or create your own).
1. Install `Tracing` in your agent.
1. Configure the message filter (optional).
1. Add the message processors to the feature.

```kotlin
// Defining a logger/file that will be used as a destination of trace messages 
val logger = KotlinLogging.logger { }
val outputPath = Path("/path/to/trace.log")

// Creating an agent
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOllamaAIExecutor(),
    llmModel = OllamaModels.Meta.LLAMA_3_2,
) {
    install(Tracing) {

        // Configure message processors to handle trace events
        addMessageProcessor(TraceFeatureMessageLogWriter(logger))
        addMessageProcessor(TraceFeatureMessageFileWriter(
            outputPath,
            { path: Path -> SystemFileSystem.sink(path).buffered() }
        ))
    }
}
```

### Message filtering

You can process all existing events or select some of them based on specific criteria. The message filter lets you control which events are processed. This is useful for focusing on specific aspects of agent runs:

```kotlin
val fileWriter = TraceFeatureMessageFileWriter(
    outputPath,
    { path: Path -> SystemFileSystem.sink(path).buffered() }
)

addMessageProcessor(fileWriter)

// Filter for LLM-related events only
fileWriter.setMessageFilter { message ->
    message is LLMCallStartingEvent || message is LLMCallCompletedEvent
}

// Filter for tool-related events only
fileWriter.setMessageFilter { message -> 
    message is ToolCallStartingEvent ||
           message is ToolCallCompletedEvent ||
           message is ToolValidationFailedEvent ||
           message is ToolCallFailedEvent
}

// Filter for node execution events only
fileWriter.setMessageFilter { message -> 
    message is NodeExecutionStartingEvent || message is NodeExecutionCompletedEvent
}
```

### Large trace volumes

For agents with complex strategies or long-running executions, the volume of trace events can be substantial. Consider using the following methods to manage the volume of events:

- Use specific message filters to reduce the number of events.
- Implement custom message processors with buffering or sampling.
- Use file rotation for log files to prevent them from growing too large.

## Examples and quickstarts

### Basic tracing to logger

```kotlin
// Create a logger
val logger = KotlinLogging.logger { }

fun main() {
    runBlocking {
       // Create an agent with tracing
       val agent = AIAgent(
          promptExecutor = simpleOllamaAIExecutor(),
          llmModel = OllamaModels.Meta.LLAMA_3_2,
       ) {
          install(Tracing) {
             addMessageProcessor(TraceFeatureMessageLogWriter(logger))
          }
       }

       // Run the agent
       agent.run("Hello, agent!")
    }
}
```

## Error handling and edge cases

### No message processors

If no message processors are added to the Tracing feature, a warning will be logged:

```text
Tracing Feature. No feature out stream providers are defined. Trace streaming has no target.
```

The feature will still intercept events, but they will not be processed or output anywhere.

### Resource management

Message processors may hold resources (like file handles) that need to be properly released. Use the `use` extension function to ensure proper cleanup:

```kotlin
// Creating an agent
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOllamaAIExecutor(),
    llmModel = OllamaModels.Meta.LLAMA_3_2,
) {
    val writer = TraceFeatureMessageFileWriter(
        outputPath,
        { path: Path -> SystemFileSystem.sink(path).buffered() }
    )

    install(Tracing) {
        addMessageProcessor(writer)
    }
}
// Run the agent
agent.run(input)
// Writer will be automatically closed when the block exits
```

### Tracing specific events to file

```kotlin
install(Tracing) {

    val fileWriter = TraceFeatureMessageFileWriter(
        outputPath, 
        { path: Path -> SystemFileSystem.sink(path).buffered() }
    )
    addMessageProcessor(fileWriter)

    // Only trace LLM calls
    fileWriter.setMessageFilter { message ->
        message is LLMCallStartingEvent || message is LLMCallCompletedEvent
    }
}
```

### Tracing specific events to remote endpoint

You use tracing to remote endpoints when you need to send event data via the network. Once initiated, tracing to a remote endpoint launches a light server at the specified port number and sends events via Kotlin Server-Sent Events (SSE).

```kotlin
// Creating an agent
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOllamaAIExecutor(),
    llmModel = OllamaModels.Meta.LLAMA_3_2,
) {
    val connectionConfig = DefaultServerConnectionConfig(host = host, port = port)
    val writer = TraceFeatureMessageRemoteWriter(
        connectionConfig = connectionConfig
    )

    install(Tracing) {
        addMessageProcessor(writer)
    }
}
// Run the agent
agent.run(input)
// Writer will be automatically closed when the block exits
```

On the client side, you can use `FeatureMessageRemoteClient` to receive events and deserialize them.

```kotlin
val clientConfig = DefaultClientConnectionConfig(host = host, port = port, protocol = URLProtocol.HTTP)
val agentEvents = mutableListOf<DefinedFeatureEvent>()

val clientJob = launch {
    FeatureMessageRemoteClient(connectionConfig = clientConfig, scope = this).use { client ->
        val collectEventsJob = launch {
            client.receivedMessages.consumeAsFlow().collect { event ->
                // Collect events from server
                agentEvents.add(event as DefinedFeatureEvent)

                // Stop collecting events on agent finished
                if (event is AgentCompletedEvent) {
                    cancel()
                }
            }
        }
        client.connect()
        collectEventsJob.join()
        client.healthCheck()
    }
}

listOf(clientJob).joinAll()
```
